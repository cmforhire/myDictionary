# myDictionary
The code to define any word of the English language

This program was designed to mimic an online dictionary. There are only a few highlights to keep in mind and I have listed them below: 
1. When you type a word, it returns the definition
2. When you type a non-existing word, it will inform you to double check your entry
3. When you have a typo, the dictionary will suggest the word closest to it and prompt you to confirm it
4. Acronyms such as "USA" or "NATO" are not exhibited, the program recognizes these words 
5. Recognizes pronouns such as Paris or Canada, beginning with capital letters 
6. You can type the number 0 to end the program

Thank you for trying out my Dictionary!
